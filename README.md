FuelCMS---Related-Entries
=========================

FuelCMS - DRY Base Module with related entries

This model is meant to be used with FuelCMS's advanced modules. The idea is to have a simple way to create simple one_to_many relations between models. 

# Installation
1. Copy this file inside your own advanced module's 'libaries' folder
2. Grab a copy of jQuery's 'Chosen' plugin here: http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/ and save it inside your module's assets. More on this later.

# Usage
All the modules involved will have to extend the Related_entries_model (and its record class Related_entry_model)
